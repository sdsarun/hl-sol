# Performance Test Strategy Plan for New Project

## Solution
I will use **load testing** as primary to make sure that our application can handle a certain amount of users or traffic without breaking down. It helps to understand our system performs when there are a lot of people using it at the same time.

### Explain to project manager in example:

Imagine we have an online store like shopee. During a sale, a lot of customers might try to buy products at the same time.

If our website isn't ready for that much traffic, it could slow down or crash, causing customers to get frustrated and leave.

## Plans

I assume we are working with the Scrum process (2-week sprints).

I recommend doing load testing once the core features of the application are done. For example, testing the critical user flows like browsing products, adding them to the cart, and completing the payment process.

**Testing Process (Over a 2-Week Sprint):**
- **Days 1-2:** The testing team sets everything up, makes sure the tools are working, and prepares the test scenarios (this takes about 1-2 days).
- **Days 3-5:** We run the load tests, simulating real-life traffic like customers shopping and completing their purchases (this typically takes about 3-5 days).
- **Days 6-10:** After the tests, we look at the results to find any problems, like slowdowns or crashes. Then we fix those issues to make sure the system can handle a lot of users (this usually takes another 4-5 days).
